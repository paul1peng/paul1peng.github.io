      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Paul Peng (b. 1994) is a Chinese American furry contemporary artist
        specializing in drawings and comics of monster boys in situations.
        He holds a BCSA in Computer Science and Art from Carnegie Mellon
        University and has also studied classical drawing at Barnstone
        Studios in Coplay,&nbsp;PA&nbsp;(2013) and experimental drawing at the
        <span style="white-space: nowrap">Ox-Bow</span> School of Art in
        Saugatuck,&nbsp;MI&nbsp;(2017).
      </p>
      <p>
        As an artist, Paul has shown in multiple group and solo exhibitions
        across the Pittsburgh region and occasionally outside of it. He has
        been an artist-in-residence with the Brew House Association (2020–2021,
        Pittsburgh,&nbsp;PA), the Ox-Bow School of Art (2023), and Stove Works
        (2024, Chattanooga,&nbsp;TN). He has also provided illustrations and
        comics for the LUCKYME Advent Calendar 22 music compilation (2022),
        ECOTONE Vol. 1 (Cram Books, 2023), and CRAM&nbsp;#4: Bad News for
        Big Rubes (Cram Books, 2024). He made his curatorial debut in 2025
        as one of the four co-curators of Room&nbsp;Party: Furry Art at
        the Beginning of the World, the first large-scale group exhibition by
        and of furries working in and next to contemporary and experimental art.

        Alongside his art practice, Paul is a roller coaster enthusiast,
        a programming language design hobbyist, and an aspiring competitive
        Dance&shy;Dance&shy;Revolution player. He currently lives and works
        from Pittsburgh,&nbsp;PA.

      <h2>Statement</h2>
      <p>
        I make non-representational and cartoon drawings based on what it feels
        like to be a real person. I began drawing like this as a teenager
        witnessing and participating in an internet-based folk art tradition
        of other sad queer teens drawing themselves as anthropomorphic fantasy
        creatures, anime monster boys, and other cartoons of things that they
        are not. Many motifs from this folk cartooning tradition show up in my
        work, but I am less interested in depicting this tradition’s narrative
        history and more interested in how my work, regardless of what it
        depicts, directly extends this tradition. How does my art, born from
        queer teen alienation, exist under conditions where that alienation
        used to exist but no longer&nbsp;does?
