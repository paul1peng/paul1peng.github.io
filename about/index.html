        Paul Peng (b. 1994) is a drawing-based contemporary artist whose work
        combines formal mark-making with cartoon figuration, the latter being
        rooted in his upbringing around internet-based folk art in communities
        surrounding furry culture and mass media fandoms. He holds a BCSA in
        Computer Science and Art from Carnegie Mellon University and has also
        studied classical drawing at Barnstone Studios in Coplay,&nbsp;PA and
        experimental drawing at the Ox-Bow School of Art in&nbsp;Saugatuck,&nbsp;MI.

        Since completing undergrad in 2017, Paul has shown in multiple group
        and solo shows across Pittsburgh and has also exhibited work as part of a
        group show in Philadelphia at Little Berlin in 2018. He has also
        collaborated with experimental comics publisher 2dcloud, who has
        published excerpts from his sketchbook on their website and released
        an interview with him in their fifth issue of Altcomics&nbsp;Magazine.

        Alongside his drawing and comics practice, Paul has experimented in
        the past with stone lithography and conceptual writing. He currently
        lives and works in Pittsburgh, PA, where he regularly attends the
        Pittsburgh Comics Salon and the Unblurred First Friday gallery crawls
        whenever a pandemic isn’t&nbsp;happening.
