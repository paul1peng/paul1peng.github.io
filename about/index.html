      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Paul Peng (b. 1994) likes to make a lot of art and show some of it.
        He holds a BCSA in Computer Science and Art from Carnegie Mellon
        University and has also studied classical drawing at Barnstone
        Studios in Coplay,&nbsp;PA&nbsp;(2013) and experimental drawing at the
        <span style="white-space: nowrap">Ox-Bow</span> School of Art in
        Saugatuck,&nbsp;MI&nbsp;(2017).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since completing undergrad in 2017, Paul has shown in multiple group
        and solo exhibitions across Greater Pittsburgh and occasionally
        outside of it. He has also provided illustrations for
        Talk&nbsp;Magazine Issue&nbsp;04 (2022), the LUCKYME Advent
        Calendar&nbsp;22 music compilation (2022), and ECOTONE Vol.&nbsp;1,
        a drawing anthology published by Cram Books (2023). He has been an
        artist-in-residence with the Brew House Association (Distillery
        Emerging Artists Program, 2020–2021) and the Ox-Bow School of Art
        (Summer Residency, 2023).
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside his art practice, Paul is a roller coaster enthusiast,
        a programming language design hobbyist, and an aspiring long-distance
        runner and competitive Dance&shy;Dance&shy;Revolution player. He currently lives
        and works from Pittsburgh,&nbsp;PA.

      <h2>Statement</h2>
      <p>
        I make non-representational and cartoon drawings based on what it feels
        like to be a real person. I began drawing like this as a teenager
        witnessing and participating in an internet-based folk art tradition
        of other sad queer teens drawing themselves as anthropomorphic fantasy
        creatures, anime monster boys, and other cartoons of things that they
        are not. Many motifs from this folk cartooning tradition show up in my
        work, but I am less interested in depicting this tradition’s narrative
        history and more interested in how my work, regardless of what it
        depicts, directly extends this tradition. How does my art, born from
        queer teen alienation, exist under conditions where that alienation
        used to exist but no longer&nbsp;does?
