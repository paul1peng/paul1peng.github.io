      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Paul Peng (b. 1994) is a drawing-based contemporary artist whose work
        combines non-representational mark-making with cartoon figuration.  He holds a BCSA
        in Computer Science and Art from Carnegie Mellon University’s Intercollege
        Degree Program and has also studied classical drawing at Barnstone Studios in Coplay,&nbsp;PA
        and experimental drawing at the <span style="white-space: nowrap">Ox-Bow</span> School of Art
        in&nbsp;Saugatuck,&nbsp;MI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since completing undergrad in 2017, Paul has shown in multiple
        group and solo exhibitions across Pittsburgh and was also a member
        of the eleventh cohort of the Brew House Association’s
        Distillery Emerging Artist Residency program. He has also
        collaborated with experimental comics publisher 2dcloud, who has
        published excerpts from his sketchbook on their website and released
        an interview with him in their fifth issue of Altcomics&nbsp;Magazine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside his drawing and comics practice, Paul has experimented in
        the past with stone lithography and conceptual writing. He currently
        lives and works from Pittsburgh,&nbsp;PA.
      </p>
      <h2>Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Working from my personal history and experience with furry culture
        and mass media fandoms, I approach cartooning as a form of abstract
        expressionist drawing. My work weaves soft boyish faces, monstrous
        fantasy bodies, and lushly rendered urban and pastoral settings
        through a warp of stormy non-representational marks, creating
        dense pictures that contest and complicate narrative meaning-making
        in favor of the raw, open-ended energy of an atomic cartoon moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to explore what cartoon figures and spaces born from queer
        teen alienation can express in a world where that alienation used
        to exist but no longer does, and how these expressions can carve
        out new ways of imaging and imagining how gay bodies navigate
        this&nbsp;larger&nbsp;world.
